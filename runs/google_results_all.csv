1. **Formulate a Differential Equation**: Express the length of the subnormal as \(y \frac{dy}{dx}\) and the arithmetic mean of the coordinates as \(\frac{x+y}{2}\). Equate these to form the differential equation \(2y \frac{dy}{dx} = x+y\).
2. **Solve the Homogeneous Equation**: Recognize the differential equation as homogeneous and substitute \(y=vx\), leading to \(\frac{dy}{dx} = v + x \frac{dv}{dx}\). Substitute these into the differential equation and simplify to get \(2vx \frac{dv}{dx} = 1+v-2v^2\).
3. **Integrate Separated Variables**: Separate the variables to get \(\frac{2v}{(1-v)(1+2v)} dv = \frac{1}{x} dx\). Use partial fractions to integrate, resulting in \(\frac{2}{3} \left( -\ln|1-v| + \frac{1}{2}\ln|1+2v| \right) = \ln|x| + C'\).

The solution involves several key steps:

1. **Formulate a Differential Equation**: Express the length of the subnormal as \(y \frac{dy}{dx}\) and the arithmetic mean of the coordinates as \(\frac{x+y}{2}\). Equate these to form the differential equation \(2y \frac{dy}{dx} = x+y\).
2. **Solve the Homogeneous Equation**: Recognize the differential equation as homogeneous and substitute \(y=vx\), leading to \(\frac{dy}{dx} = v + x \frac{dv}{dx}\). Substitute these into the differential equation and simplify to get \(2vx \frac{dv}{dx} = 1+v-2v^2\).
3. **Integrate Separated Variables**: Separate the variables to get \(\frac{2v}{(1-v)(1+2v)} dv = \frac{1}{x} dx\). Use partial fractions to integrate, resulting in \(\frac{2}{3} \left( -\ln|1-v| + \frac{1}{2}\ln|1+2v| \right) = \ln|x| + C'\).
4. **Simplify and Substitute Back**: Simplify the integrated equation and substitute back \(v=y/x\) to obtain \((x+2y)^{1/3} = K(x-y)^{2/3}\). Cube both sides to get \((x+2y) = K^3(x-y)^2\).
5. **Apply Initial Condition**: Use the initial condition that the curve intersects the x-axis at \(x=1\), meaning it passes through \((1,0)\). Substitute these values into the equation to find \(K^3=1\).

The solution involves several key steps:

1. **Formulate a Differential Equation**: Express the length of the subnormal as \(y \frac{dy}{dx}\) and the arithmetic mean of the coordinates as \(\frac{x+y}{2}\). Equate these to form the differential equation \(2y \frac{dy}{dx} = x+y\).
2. **Solve the Homogeneous Equation**: Recognize the differential equation as homogeneous and substitute \(y=vx\), leading to \(\frac{dy}{dx} = v + x \frac{dv}{dx}\). Substitute these into the differential equation and simplify to get \(2vx \frac{dv}{dx} = 1+v-2v^2\).
3. **Integrate Separated Variables**: Separate the variables to get \(\frac{2v}{(1-v)(1+2v)} dv = \frac{1}{x} dx\). Use partial fractions to integrate, resulting in \(\frac{2}{3} \left( -\ln|1-v| + \frac{1}{2}\ln|1+2v| \right) = \ln|x| + C'\).
4. **Simplify and Substitute Back**: Simplify the integrated equation and substitute back \(v=y/x\) to obtain \((x+2y)^{1/3} = K(x-y)^{2/3}\). Cube both sides to get \((x+2y) = K^3(x-y)^2\).
5. **Apply Initial Condition**: Use the initial condition that the curve intersects the x-axis at \(x=1\), meaning it passes through \((1,0)\). Substitute these values into the equation to find \(K^3=1\).

Since the two circles touch each other externally, the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii. Thus,  sqrt((h-0)^2 + (k-1)^2) = |k| + 1.
