The image shows a mathematical problem involving trigonometric functions and matching entries between two columns. The problem defines a function \(f_n(\theta)\) as a ratio of sums of cosine and sine terms. The numerator consists of a sum of cosine functions with arguments \(\frac{\theta}{2}\), \(2\theta\), \(\frac{7\theta}{2}\), up to \((3n-2)\frac{\theta}{2}\). The denominator consists of a sum of sine functions with the same arguments as the cosine functions in the numerator. Column-I lists values of the function \(f_n(\theta)\) for specific values of \(n\) and \(\theta\), while Column-II lists numerical values.
